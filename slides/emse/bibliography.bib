	abstract = {The transport and energy sectors currently face a critical juncture as the global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) prompts a greater emphasis on EV charging and its impact on the electricity grid. EV smart charging has the potential to alleviate strain on the grid while offering additional advantages, such as improved integration of renewable energy sources and cheaper electricity. However, the success of this technology hinges on the willingness of EV drivers to participate in smart charging programs. To explore this topic, this study utilizes stated preference data to examine consumer preferences towards smart charging programs features. Consumer willingness to participate in smart charging program was found to decline with increase in smart charging electricity price as well as with increase in electricity price for manual charging during peak hours. As expected, higher daily guaranteed driving range  was found to increase consumer willingness to participate. Financial incentive in the form of annual electricity bill credit was found to increase consumer willingness to participate. As a pioneering research investigating consumer preferences towards smart charging programs, this study contributes essential knowledge and policy recommendations crucial for the seamless and successful implementation of smart charging initiatives.},

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology could turn electric vehicles (EVs) into a potentially valuable solution to the problem of increased load demand caused by large-scale EV integration. Successful market penetration of V2G relies not only on developing the technology itself, but also on EV drivers' willingness to participate in this technology. This paper aims to explore Dutch EV drivers' preferences for participating in V2G contracts. In particular, we conduct a context-dependent stated choice experiment to examine the impact of EV recharging technology on the V2G contract preferences. Two contexts have been designed: the current EV recharging time and fast recharging. Our results show that in the context of current recharging time, Dutch EV drivers in general prefer not to participate in V2G contracts, while the opposite is true in the context of fast recharging. With regard to specific V2G contract attributes, Dutch EV drivers are most concerned about ‘discharging cycles’. Also important to them is ‘the guaranteed minimum battery level’, but its importance drops significantly in the fast charging context. In addition, ‘monthly remuneration’ and ‘plug-in time’ also influence people's preferences for adopting V2G. From these findings, we draw the implications for the aggregator and policy makers.},
