    "text": "Project Summary\nThis project aims to understand BEV owners’ preferences with respect to participating in the Smart Charging programs to improve grid resilience and enable greater integration of renewable energy onto the grid. The three-year project will be performed in two research thrusts:\n\nThrust One: Measure and model BEV charging preferences using conjoint survey.\nThrust Two: Simulate grid performance under different SMC and V2G scenarios.\n\nThe Smart Charging programs contain both SMC and V2G:\n\nSMC is short for “Supplier-Managed Charging”. It allows the charging stations to monitor, manage, and even restrict the charging process to optimize energy consumption.\nV2G is short for “Vehicle-to-Grid”. It allows bidirectional charging, so that the vehicle can discharge a certain amount of electricity back to the grid to further optimize energy consumption by balancing supply and demand.\n\nThe EV charging survey for the first thrust can be accessed here:\n\n EV Charging Survey \n\nThe second thrust is also in early stages, and we are coordinating with partners to begin modeling grid performance under different BEV loading scenarios.\nThis project is supported by the the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s Energy and Environment Program."

The Smart Charging programs contribute to a zero-carbon power generation, and will be valuable to both the environment and the participants, including the grid providers and the BEV owners.\nWhy Conjoint Survey - A conjoint survey is a pilot simulation to people’s willingness of adopting to the smart charging program. By a proper modeling, executing, and analysis process, we’ll know in what conditions will BEV owners participate in the smart charging program, and how the program will be in details."

I also want to upload it online and have it accessed in my notes.\nI’m having trouble with applying personalized fonts. For example, I tried “Ubuntu” and “Noto” fonts but they didn’t work. I didn’t have this problem in webpages. I suspect revealjs can only access online-sourced fonts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPingfan Hu"
