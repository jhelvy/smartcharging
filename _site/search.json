    "text": "PEV - PEV is short for Plug-in Electrical Vehicles. It refers to vehicles that are powered by electricity from the grid. PEVs can either be pure electricity powered (for example Tesla 3) or hybrid (for example Audi Q5 PHEV).\nSmart Charging - The term “smart charging” means to control the charging window and charging amount of the PEVs, to make sure they are mostly charged during the off-peak periods of the electricity demand.\nV2G Charging - V2G is short for vehicle-to-grid. It means to charge the electricity from the PEVs back to the grid.\nConjoint Survey - A conjoint survey question packs different attributes together into each option, so that when participants make choices, they choose the whole package instead of only one attribute. For example, when I choose to buy an iPhone, I accept its expensive price, moderate signal, and durable quality at the same time. In this case, choosing to buy a phone is a conjoint question."
