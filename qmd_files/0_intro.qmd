[*Figure 1 Prompt to DALLE 3*: Illustration in Japanese manga style depicting a cozy home setting. The focus is on the electric car plugged into a sleek wall-mounted smart charger in the garage. The ambient lighting emphasizes the charger and the car. In the background, subtly depicted, a young girl and an older man watch the charging progress on a tablet, their figures less pronounced to ensure the primary attention remains on the eco-friendly technology of the electric vehicle.]{.aside}

## The Team

This project is led by PI John Paul Helveston from George Washington University, and is currently executed by his PhD student Pingfan Hu. The team consists of the following members:

-   John Paul Helveston, George Washington University
-   Pingfan Hu, George Washington University
-   Brian Tarroja, University of California, Irvine
-   Kate Forrest, University of California, Irvine
-   Eric Hittinger, Rochester Institute of Technology
-   Alan Jenn, University of California, Davis

## Terminologies

**PEV** - PEV is short for Plug-in Electrical Vehicles. It refers to vehicles that are powered by electricity from the grid. PEVs can either be pure electricity powered (for example Tesla 3) or hybrid (for example Audi Q5 PHEV).

**Smart Charging** - The term "smart charging" means to control the charging window and charging amount of the PEVs, to make sure they are mostly charged during the off-peak periods of the electricity demand.

**V2G Charging** - V2G is short for vehicle-to-grid. It means to charge the electricity from the PEVs back to the grid.

**Conjoint Survey** - A conjoint survey question packs different attributes together into each option, so that when participants make choices, they choose the whole package instead of only one attribute. For example, when I choose to buy an iPhone, I accept its expensive price, moderate signal, and durable quality at the same time. In this case, choosing to buy a phone is a conjoint question.

## Stage 1 Motivation

**Why Smart Charging** - As PEVs are becoming a considerable part of vehicles, it is urgent to have a better power management process. Smart charging and V2G both contribute to a zero-carbon power generation, and will be valuable to both the environment and the participants, including the grid providers and the PEV owners.

**Why Conjoint Survey** - A conjoint survey is a pilot simulation to people's willingness of adopting to the smart charging program. By a proper modeling, executing, and analysis process, we'll know in what conditions will PEV owners participate in the smart charging program, and how the program will be in details.

## Stage 2 Motivation

The team will document this part while moving to stage 2.
