[*Figure 1 Prompt to DALLE 3*: Illustration in Japanese manga style depicting a cozy home setting. The focus is on the electric car plugged into a sleek wall-mounted smart charger in the garage. The ambient lighting emphasizes the charger and the car. In the background, subtly depicted, a young girl and an older man watch the charging progress on a tablet, their figures less pronounced to ensure the primary attention remains on the eco-friendly technology of the electric vehicle.]{.aside}
