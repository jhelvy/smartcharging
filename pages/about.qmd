## Project Summary

This project aims to understand PEV owners' preferences with respect to participating in "Smart Charging" and "Vehicle-to-Grid" (V2G) programs to improve grid resilience and enable greater integration of renewable energy onto the grid. The three-year project will be performed in two research thrusts:

1. Thrust One: Measure and model PEV charging preferences using conjoint survey.
2. Thrust Two: Simulate grid performance under different smart charging and V2G scenarios.

The team is currently designing a pilot survey for the first thrust, which can be previewed [here](http://pevpilot.formr.org).

The second thrust is also in early stages, and we are coordinating with partners to begin modeling grid performance under different PEV loading scenarios.

This project is supported by the the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's [Energy and Environment Program](https://sloan.org/programs/research/energy-and-environment).
