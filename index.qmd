## The Smart Charging Project

As PEVs are becoming popular as an important commuting method, it is urgent to ensure a more sustainable electricity flow for the grid suppliers. The smart charging project is thus motivated to help achieve this.

This project aims to study PEV owners' willingness to adopt to smart charging. It is expected to last for 3 years and will be performed in 2 stages:

1.  Stage One - Measure and model PEV charging preferences using conjoint survey.
2.  Stage Two - Simulate Smart Charging Scenarios.

The team is currently in stage one, and has generated a well-structured pilot survey. The pilot survey is [available online](http://pevconjoint.formr.org), and is documented here as well.
