## The Smart Charging Project

BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) is an important solution to reduce $CO_2$ and air pollution from vehicles. As BEVs gain popularity, managing their electric load on the grid will become increasingly important.

This project aims to understand BEV owners' preferences of adopting the Smart Charging programs to improve grid resilience and enable greater integration of renewable energy onto the grid. The program contains both SMC (Supplier-Managed Charging) and V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid). See the [**About**](./pages/about.html) page for more details on the project.

This project is supported by the the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's [Energy and Environment Program](https://sloan.org/programs/research/energy-and-environment).
