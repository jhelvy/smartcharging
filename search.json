    "text": "Section 2 - Smart Charging Programs\n\nStart of Section 2\nNow that we have known basics about your EV ownership and your charging habits, let’s move on to Smart Charging program selections!\nA Smart Charging program consists of 5 attributes: Upfront Incentive, Free Level 2 Charger, Electricity Price Discount, Override Window, and Guaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs.\nHere is a brief explanation of each attribute:\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nRange\nExplanation\n\n\nUpfront Incentive:\n$100, $300, $500\nIt means the amount of money you will be instantly paid if you join the smart charging program. The unit is in USD.\n\n\nFree Level 2 Charger:\nNo or Yes\nA \"Yes\" means you will get a free level 2 charger. A level 2 charger enables faster charging than a standard home charger.\n\n\nElectricity Price Discount:\n10%, 25%, 50%\nIf you choose to join this smart charging program, this will be your electricity price discount.\n\n\nOverride Window:\n0.5 ~ 4 hrs\nThis is the longest time window per day that you can force override to regular charging, during which time your EV is not controlled by the smart charging program.\n\n\nGuaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs:\n25%, 50%, 75%\nIt means the guranteed range if your car is charged for 8 hrs during smart charging. It shows percentage here, but will be converted to mileages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table can be accessed via this link. It’s available on top of each question so that you can refer at any time.\nThe next page provides a sample question to enhance your understanding.\n\n\nSection 2 - Sample Question\nYou are provided with 2 options of smart charging programs, and an “I am not interested” option. You need to treat them as if they were your only options and choose the one that you most prefer. You can choose the “I am not interested” option if you are not interested in either.\nYou can access the attribute table using this link.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions:\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\nUpfront Incentive:\n$100\n$500\n\n\nFree Level 2 Charger:\nNo\nYes\n\n\nElectricity Price Discount:\n25%\n50%\n\n\nOverride Window:\n0.5 hrs\n4 hrs\n\n\nGuaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs:\n100 miles\n300 miles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\nI am not interested\n\n\n\nSection 2 - Ready to Start the Questions\nThe sample question is quite straight-forward. Since Option 2 has every attribute better than Option 1, I bet you have chosen it.\nHowever, this simplicity is not always the case. There will be trade-offs between the 2 options, and you need to make your own decision. For example, one option might have a large up-front but a low discount, while the other one is the inverse. Then, you need to make decisions based on your preference.\nThere are 5 choice questions in total. For each question, you have 2 valid options to choose from. Again, you make your choice as if they were your ONLY options. If you are really not interested in either of them, you can choose “I am not interested”.\nClick on “Next Page” to proceed.\n\n\nQuestion 1 of 5\n(1 of 5) If your utility offers you these 2 smart charging programs, which one do you prefer?\nYou can access the attribute table using this link.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions:\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\nUpfront Incentive:\n$300\n$100\n\n\nFree Level 2 Charger:\nNo\nYes\n\n\nElectricity Price Discount:\n10%\n50%\n\n\nOverride Window:\n1 hrs\n1 hrs\n\n\nGuaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs:\n50 %\n25 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\nI am not interested\n\n\n\nQuestion 2 of 5\n(2 of 5) If your utility offers you these 2 smart charging programs, which one do you prefer?\nYou can access the attribute table using this link.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions:\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\nUpfront Incentive:\n$100\n$100\n\n\nFree Level 2 Charger:\nNo\nYes\n\n\nElectricity Price Discount:\n25%\n50%\n\n\nOverride Window:\n0.5 hrs\n0.5 hrs\n\n\nGuaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs:\n25 %\n25 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\nI am not interested\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 of 5\n(3 of 5) If your utility offers you these 2 smart charging programs, which one do you prefer?\nYou can access the attribute table using this link.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions:\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\nUpfront Incentive:\n$100\n$500\n\n\nFree Level 2 Charger:\nYes\nNo\n\n\nElectricity Price Discount:\n10%\n50%\n\n\nOverride Window:\n2 hrs\n2 hrs\n\n\nGuaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs:\n50 %\n50 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\nI am not interested\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 of 5\n(4 of 5) If your utility offers you these 2 smart charging programs, which one do you prefer?\nYou can access the attribute table using this link.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions:\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\nUpfront Incentive:\n$300\n$100\n\n\nFree Level 2 Charger:\nYes\nNo\n\n\nElectricity Price Discount:\n50%\n50%\n\n\nOverride Window:\n2 hrs\n0.5 hrs\n\n\nGuaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs:\n75 %\n25 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\nI am not interested\n\n\n\nQuestion 5 of 5\n(5 of 5) If your utility offers you these 2 smart charging programs, which one do you prefer?\nYou can access the attribute table using this link.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions:\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\nUpfront Incentive:\n$100\n$500\n\n\nFree Level 2 Charger:\nYes\nNo\n\n\nElectricity Price Discount:\n50%\n10%\n\n\nOverride Window:\n2 hrs\n0.5 hrs\n\n\nGuaranteed Range if charged for 8 hrs:\n75 %\n50 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\nI am not interested\n\n\n\nEnd of Section 2\nGood job!

PEVs can either be pure electricity powered (for example Tesla 3) or hybrid (for example Audi Q5 PHEV).\nSmart Charging - The term “smart charging” means to control the charging window and charging amount of the PEVs, to make sure they are mostly charged during the off-peak periods of the electricity demand.\nV2G Charging - V2G is short for vehicle-to-grid. It means to charge the electricity from the PEVs back to the grid.\nConjoint Survey - A conjoint survey question packs different attributes together into each option, so that when participants make choices, they choose the whole package instead of only one attribute. For example, when I choose to buy an iPhone, I accept its expensive price, moderate signal, and durable quality at the same time. In this case, choosing to buy a phone is a conjoint question."

Smart charging and V2G both contribute to a zero-carbon power generation, and will be valuable to both the environment and the participants, including the grid providers and the PEV owners.\nWhy Conjoint Survey - A conjoint survey is a pilot simulation to people’s willingness of adopting to the smart charging program. By a proper modeling, executing, and analysis process, we’ll know in what conditions will PEV owners participate in the smart charging program, and how the program will be in details."
