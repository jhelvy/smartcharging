It allows bidirectional charging, so that the vehicle can discharge a certain amount of electricity back to the grid to further optimize energy consumption by balancing supply and demand.\n\nThe EV charging survey for the first thrust can be accessed here:\n\n EV Charging Survey \n\nThe second thrust is also in early stages, and we are coordinating with partners to begin modeling grid performance under different BEV loading scenarios.\nThis project is supported by the the Alfred P.
