    "text": "This image was generated using the following prompt to DALLE 3: Illustration in Japanese manga style depicting a cozy home setting. The focus is on the electric car plugged into a sleek wall-mounted smart charger in the garage. The ambient lighting emphasizes the charger and the car. In the background, subtly depicted, a young girl and an older man watch the charging progress on a tablet, their figures less pronounced to ensure the primary attention remains on the eco-friendly technology of the electric vehicle."

    "text": "Project Summary\nThis project aims to understand PEV owners’ preferences with respect to participating in “Smart Charging” and “Vehicle-to-Grid” (V2G) programs to improve grid resilience and enable greater integration of renewable energy onto the grid. The three-year project will be performed in two research thrusts:\n\nThrust One: Measure and model PEV charging preferences using conjoint survey.\nThrust Two: Simulate grid performance under different smart charging and V2G scenarios.\n\nThe team is currently designing a pilot survey for the first thrust, which can be previewed here.\nThe second thrust is also in early stages, and we are coordinating with partners to begin modeling grid performance under different PEV loading scenarios.\nThis project is supported by the the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s Energy and Environment Program."

    "text": "PEV - PEV is short for Plug-in Electrical Vehicles. It refers to vehicles that are powered by electricity from the grid. PEVs can either be pure electricity powered (for example Tesla 3) or hybrid (for example Audi Q5 PHEV).\nSmart Charging - The term “smart charging” means to control the charging window and charging amount of the PEVs, to make sure they are mostly charged during the off-peak periods of the electricity demand.\nV2G Charging - V2G is short for vehicle-to-grid. It means to charge the electricity from the PEVs back to the grid.\nConjoint Survey - A conjoint survey question packs different attributes together into each option, so that when participants make choices, they choose the whole package instead of only one attribute. For example, when I choose to buy an iPhone, I accept its expensive price, moderate signal, and durable quality at the same time. In this case, choosing to buy a phone is a conjoint question."

    "text": "Q & A\nWhy Smart Charging - As PEVs are becoming a considerable part of vehicles, it is urgent to have a better power management process. Smart charging and V2G both contribute to a zero-carbon power generation, and will be valuable to both the environment and the participants, including the grid providers and the PEV owners.\nWhy Conjoint Survey - A conjoint survey is a pilot simulation to people’s willingness of adopting to the smart charging program. By a proper modeling, executing, and analysis process, we’ll know in what conditions will PEV owners participate in the smart charging program, and how the program will be in details."
